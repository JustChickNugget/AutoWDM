Author - JustChickNugget (me)

Version: 1.6

Description: Runs Wooting-Double-Movement when Fortnite is running

Language: C# (.NET Core 5.0). You may need to install this: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-5.0.13-windows-x64-installer

## Help
**WDM = Wooting-Double-Movement**

---

If Fortnite is running and WDM isn't running - WDM starts

If Fortnite isn't running and WDM is running -  WDM closes

If Fortnite and WDM isn't running or running - nothing happens

---

**After the version 1.4 you can choose your check frequency (ms)**

**1.6 is the final version until I or you find any bugs**
